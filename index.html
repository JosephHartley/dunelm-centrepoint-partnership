          It takes more than a roof to end youth homelessness. Young people need

        <p>
          To launch our new 'Joy of Home' charity partnership, Dunelm and
          Centrepoint commissioned a study asking homeless and vulnerable 16-25
          year olds about their experiences of home. 72% of young people
          associated home with traumatic and negative events that contributed to
          them becoming homeless. 30% had never experienced a truly happy home.
          Home is more than just a roof, it's the place from which the rest of
          our lives can thrive.
        </p>
        <h4 class="focus-text">
          This is why Dunelm has chosen Centrepoint to be our new national
          charity partner. Together, we will put the joy of home at the heart of
          ending youth homelessness.
        </h4>
        <p>
          We are going to show how a 'home not a hostel' helps young people
          better recover from the trauma of homelessness. We will help young
          people ready to live independently get set up in their new home.
          Crucially, we will raise awareness of 'Stepping Stone Homes',
          specialist housing for formally homeless young people, driving change
          and enabling more Stepping Stone Homes to be built across the UK.

              youth homelessness for the next generation. For a young person who
              has experienced considerable trauma, they need a home, somewhere
              they can settle and feel safe to learn that they have potential
              and are deserving of a happy life. It takes a home, not just a
              roof to truly break the cycle of homelessness and I am delighted
              that we will be able to bring this to life through our new
              transformational partnership with Dunelm."
